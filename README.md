MONOPOLY is the game of buying, renting or selling Properties so
profitably that players increase their wealth â€“ the wealthiest
becoming the eventual winner.
Starting from the "GO" space, move your token around the board
according to your roll of the dice. When you land on a Property that
is not already owned by anyone else, you may buy it from the Bank.
Players who own Properties collect rents from opponents stopping
there. You must always obey the instructions given
on Chance cards.

# Sparta_Global_Game
Game project
MONOPOLY is the game of buying, renting or selling Properties so
profitably that players increase their wealth â€“ the wealthiest
becoming the eventual winner.
Starting from the "GO" space, move your token around the board
according to your roll of the dice. When you land on a Property that
is not already owned by anyone else, you may buy it from the Bank.
Players who own Properties collect rents from opponents stopping
there, with players owning sets getting twice as much rent. You must always obey the instructions given
on Chance cards.

The project had to be completed over the course of two sprints, totalling a week's worth of work.
